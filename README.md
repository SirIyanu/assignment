the first article from w3schools talks about array methods
Array itself is a list [] that can take in several data types e.g strings, objects, booleans etcetera.
we have several of them i.e array length, array splice, array pop, push etcetera. the length  which is used by adding .length to the variable housing the array returns the length of the array
pop method removes the last element from the array while push adds to the end of the array

the second article also from W3schools talks about Functions
Function is a block of code built to perform a particular task when it is called.
it can take in parameters in () and then when it is called the values inputed to test if it works are called 'arguments'
functions have a cool feature known as return which must be inside the function so it can execute the code when it is called.

the next article is about control flows. There are three main control flow statements i.e. if/else, switch and loop statements
if/else statements are used to execute a block of codes if a certain condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false
switch statements are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a avriable or expression
loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition. there are for, while and do while loops
